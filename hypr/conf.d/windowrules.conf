## Window rules
##
# This file defines behaviour for specific applications.  You can match
# windows by class, title or app_id.  Use regular expressions to match
# multiple windows.  Each rule is of the form:
#   windowrule = <action>, <match>

# Kitty: keep window contents opaque while allowing the compositor behind
# it to blur.  Set the same active/inactive opacity so there's no
# flicker when focusing.  Match the default kitty class.
windowrule = opacity 0.94 override 0.94 override 1.0, class:^(kitty)$

# Floating versions of Kitty: float and centre windows launched with
# `--class kitty-floating` (see binds.conf).  Also keep their
# backgrounds blurred/opaque like the default kitty.
windowrule = float, class:^(kitty-floating)$
windowrule = center, class:^(kitty-floating)$
windowrule = opacity 0.94 override 0.94 override 1.0, class:^(kitty-floating)$

# Yazi in a floating terminal: match by class `yazi-floating` so that
# our custom binding launches into a floating, centered window.
windowrule = float, class:^(yazi-floating)$
windowrule = center, class:^(yazi-floating)$
windowrule = opacity 0.94 override 0.94 override 1.0, class:^(yazi-floating)$

# Yazi launched normally (without the custom class) matches by title
# and also floats and centres the window.
windowrule = float, title:^(yazi)$
windowrule = center, title:^(yazi)$

# Wofi: always float and centre, and remove borders for a clean look.
windowrule = float, class:^(wofi)$
windowrule = center, class:^(wofi)$
windowrule = noborder, class:^(wofi)$

# Nautilus file manager: float and centre new instances for quick
# file browsing.
windowrule = float, class:^(org\.gnome\.Nautilus)$
windowrule = center, class:^(org\.gnome\.Nautilus)$

# Hyprshot GUI: float and centre screenshot selector windows.
windowrule = float, title:^(hyprshot)$
windowrule = center, title:^(hyprshot)$

# Code OSS (VS Code): tile by default.
windowrule = tile, class:^(code-oss)$

# Zen browser: tile by default; change to float if you prefer the
# browser to open as a floating window.
windowrule = tile, class:^(zen)$
