## Autostart commands
##
# This file contains commands that Hyprland will run once when it
# starts.  Use `exec-once` for things that should only start once per
# session and `exec` for commands that should run every time the
# config is reloaded.

# Import the system's DBus environment variables so that apps launch
# correctly under a Wayland session.
exec-once = dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd DISPLAY WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP

# Start the wallpaper daemon.  Hyprpaper reads `~/.config/hyprpaper.conf`.
exec-once = hyprpaper

# Launch Waybar as the status bar.
exec-once = waybar

# Start the notification daemon (Dunst).  Without this, you won't see
# any popup notifications.  See ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc for styling.
exec-once = dunst

# You can optionally start a clipboard manager.  Uncomment if you
# install wl-clipboard-history or clipman.
# exec-once = wl-clipboard-history -l 25 -t 5000

# Start a lock/idle daemon.  Uncomment the following line if you
# install hypridle and want the screen to lock after a period of
# inactivity.  The accompanying configuration would live in
# ~/.config/hypridle.conf.
# exec-once = hypridle -c ~/.config/hypridle.conf

# Restore the last wallpaper and colour scheme.  This script will
# detect the current wallpaper (or the one passed as an argument) and
# regenerate colour files for Hyprland, Waybar, Wofi, Kitty and Dunst.
exec-once = ~/.config/hypr/scripts/update-colors.sh
