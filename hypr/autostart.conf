# Hyprland autostart configuration for the refreshed rice
# This configuration launches Waypaper to manage wallpapers and the Waybar
# panel alongside the notification daemon.  It avoids starting multiple
# instances of Waybar and does not include Eww.  See the README for details.

# Import DBus environment for Wayland sessions
exec-once = dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd DISPLAY WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP

# Restore the last wallpaper using Waypaper
# Waypaper will read ~/.config/waypaper/config.ini and restore the previous
# wallpaper on login【287881426529676†L28-L33】.  It also runs our colour update
# script via the post_command hook.
exec-once = hyprpaper
exec-once = waypaper --restore

# Start Waybar exactly once.  Waybar will read its configuration from
# ~/.config/waybar/config.jsonc and styles from ~/.config/waybar/style.css.
exec-once = waybar

# Start the notification daemon
exec-once = dunst
