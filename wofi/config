# Wofi configuration
#
# This file defines how wofi behaves and where it looks for
# colours and styles.  It uses a dark theme and enables
# fuzzy matching for a modern application launcher.  Colours
# are populated by the `update-colors.sh` script into
# ~/.config/wofi/colors.

# Display the desktop run menu (equivalent to `wofi --show drun`)
show = drun

# Use the custom colour palette and CSS file generated by
# update‑colors.sh.  These paths are resolved relative to
# $XDG_CONFIG_HOME.
colors = ~/.config/wofi/colors
style = ~/.config/wofi/style.css

# Set the prompt displayed next to the search entry
prompt = 

# Fuzzy matching makes finding applications easier
matching = fuzzy

# Hide the scroll bar for a cleaner look
hide_scroll = true

# Display icons alongside application names
allow_images = true

# Set window dimensions (0 means adapt to content height)
width = 600
height = 0

# Position the window roughly centred
location = center

# Number of columns and spacing between entries
columns = 1
line_height = 32

# Always run wofi as a layer-shell overlay so it appears above
# other content in Hyprland
layer = overlay
