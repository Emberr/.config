## Per–window rules
#
# Use these rules to fine‑tune the behaviour of certain applications.
# For example, you can force an application to open as floating,
# centre it on screen, or apply blur/transparency to its background
# without changing its content.  The syntax is
#   windowrule = <rule>, <identifier>
# Identifiers can match by class, title or app_id.

# Kitty: keep window contents opaque while allowing the compositor
# behind it to blur.  We set the same active/inactive opacity so
# there’s no flicker when focusing【378759060785602†L420-L552】.
