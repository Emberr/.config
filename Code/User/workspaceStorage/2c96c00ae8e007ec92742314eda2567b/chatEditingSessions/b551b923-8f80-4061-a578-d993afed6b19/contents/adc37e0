## Hyprland main configuration file
#
# This file sources several smaller configuration files to keep your
# setup organised.  Each fragment lives in the same directory and can
# be edited independently.  The order of the `source` lines matters
# because later files override earlier definitions.

# Pull in colour variables generated by Pywal/Matugen.  The
# `update-colors.sh` script writes this file to `~/.cache/wal/colors-hyprland.conf`.
# Use conditional sourcing to avoid errors if the file doesn't exist
$colors_file = ~/.cache/wal/colors-hyprland.conf
source = ~/.config/hypr/colors.conf

# Environment variables (NVIDIA and Wayland tweaks)
source = ~/.config/hypr/env.conf

# Generic compositor settings
source = ~/.config/hypr/general.conf

# Input devices
source = ~/.config/hypr/input.conf

# Decorations and blur
source = ~/.config/hypr/decorations.conf

# Window rules for specific applications
source = ~/.config/hypr/windowrules.conf

# Keybindings
source = ~/.config/hypr/binds.conf

# Applications to run on startup
source = ~/.config/hypr/autostart.conf
