# Dunst notification daemon configuration
#
# This configuration is based on the example from
# /etc/dunst/dunstrc as suggested by the ArchWiki【807771026737053†L137-L144】.
# It tweaks colours and sizing to better integrate with the dark colour
# palette generated by your update‑colors script.  Feel free to
# experiment with geometry, padding and timeouts to suit your taste.
